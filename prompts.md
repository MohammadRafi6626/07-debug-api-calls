## Design Prompt
Build a dark-themed, responsive movie search page with a header (including an icon and title), a centered search bar, and two sections for results and a watchlist. Use a grid of cards for displaying movie information (poster, title, and year) with buttons to add/remove movies. Add subtle hover effects and a simple footer.

## Prompt 1
Fetch movies from the OMDb API when the user searches, and display each movie's poster, title, and release year inside the movie results grid.

## Prompt 2
Modify the JavaScript so that clicking an 'Add to Watchlist' button adds the movie to the watchlist section. The watchlist should not contain duplicates.

## Prompt 3
I want all the movies in my watchlist to stay there even after refreshing the page.

If the watchlist is empty, display the text "Your watchlist is empty. Search for movies to add!".
